# My i.c.stars Workshop Deliverables (Completed on 10.6.2023)

**[See all these functions in action here!](https://deliv.nathanclark14.repl.co)**

## Overview
Welcome to my i.c.stars workshop deliverables repository! 
These deliverables were designed to help me practice and showcase my skills in React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and more. 

In this repository, I worked on four simple projects that demonstrated various aspects of web development.

## Projects
1. **Calculate Sum of Numbers**: I wrote a JavaScript program that calculated the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. I used a for loop to accomplish this task.

2. **Print Even Numbers**: I created a JavaScript program that used a while loop to print all even numbers from 1 to a given number `n`.

3. **Check Voting Eligibility**: I created a JavaScript function called `checkVotingEligibility` that took one parameter, `age`. Inside the function, I used an if statement to check if the age was greater than or equal to 18. This assignment focused on checking whether a person was eligible to vote based on their age.

4. **Counter in React**: For this assignment, I built a counter in React. I created a simple counter application using the React library and implemented features such as incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
